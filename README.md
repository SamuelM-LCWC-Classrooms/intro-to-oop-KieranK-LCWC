# Pet Tracker

You are going to write a simple OOP program with a pet tracker

To do this, you will perform the following tasks in your code

1. Define a class called `Pet` and give it the attributes `name`, `species` and `age`
2. Create a method called `describe()` which, when called, prints the pets details in this format
`This is {name}, a {species} who is {age} years old.`
3. Create a method called `celebrate_birthday()` which increases the pets age by 1 and prints a message in this format
`Happy Birthday {name}! You are now {age} years old!`
